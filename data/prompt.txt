Given the following definition of rhinolume:

# Definition 
Rhinolume is a congenital mutation observed in modern rhinoceros populations, characterized by the complete absence of a horn from birth. The mutation has gained attention within zoology, evolutionary biology, and conservation programs due to its ecological and social implications for horn-dependent species.

Overview

Rhinolume causes a developmental interruption in the formation of the rhinoceros horn, which normally emerges from a dense aggregation of keratin fibers atop the nasal bone. Affected individuals grow without the characteristic cranial projection yet otherwise develop typical rhinoceros physiology. The condition is non-lethal and does not impair basic locomotion, feeding, or reproductive capability.

Genetic Basis

Current studies associate the rhinolume mutation with alterations in keratin-regulating gene clusters responsible for horn growth. In affected calves, these genes show reduced or absent expression during early development. The mutation appears heritable, although expressed with variable penetrance depending on subspecies and parental lineage.

Behavioral and Ecological Effects

Field observations suggest that hornless individuals exhibit modified social behaviors. In species where horn displays play a role in dominance rituals, rhinolume rhinoceroses may adopt alternative forms of posturing or rely more heavily on body mass. In predator-dense habitats, the absence of a horn may affect defensive strategies, though adult rhinolume individuals remain formidable due to size, hide thickness, and group behaviors.
